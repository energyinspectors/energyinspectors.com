Developers' build package for EnergyInspectors.com.  Built with [HTML5Boilerplate][1], [Grunt.js][3], and [Bower][4].

###Install

0.  Install [Node.js][2]
1.  `git clone git@github.com:energyinspectors/energyinspectors.com.git`
2.  `cd energyinspectors.com`
2.  `npm install`  (this installs Grunt, Bower, and all dependencies listed in package.json, places them in ./npm_modules.)
3.  `bower install` (this installs all dependencies in bower.json, places them in ./bower_components)
4.  customize site by modifying following source files:
    - `src/html/partials/*.html`
    - `src/styles/less/main.less` (ignore /src/styles/main.less it is autogenerated)
    - `src/scripts/main.js` for custom js, `src/scripts/plugins.js` for copy-pasting plugin code
    - `src/images/`
    - `src/fonts/`
    - all other files and directories are automatically compiled from these, and can and should be ignored, make site changes only in the above directories and files.

5.  build and view unminified test version:
    - `grunt test`  (compiled output in ./test)
    - `grunt connect:test`
    - http://localhost:3000

6.  build and view minified production version:
    - `grunt dist`  (compiled output in ./dist)
    - `grunt connect:dist`
    - http://localhost:3001

7.  build and view minified and gziped production version:
    - not quite working yet, but the gzip process is:
    - `grunt gzip`
    - `grunt connect:dist`
    - http://localhost:3001

8.  update H5BP, Fancybox, JQuery, and other third party components:
    1. `npm update`  (update everything in package.json file and ./npm_modules directory)
    2. `bower update` (update all bower components in bower.json and ./bower_components directory)
    3. build system takes care of the rest, automatically copies h5bp, jquery, etc into build, test, and dist targets

When running `grunt test` or `grunt dist`, the process works like this:

1.  All previous builds in ./build, ./test, ./dist are deleted
2.  All required files and assets are copied to `./build` from the following locations:
  - `./bower_components`
  - `./src/html/partials`
  - `./src/styles/less`
  - `./src/scripts`
  - `./src/fonts`
  - `./src/images`
3.  `./build` is the staging area for compiles, from here the site is compiled from ./build to ./test (unminified, test-only) or from ./build to ./dist (minified, production-ready), depending whether you ran `grunt test` or `grunt dist` respectively.
